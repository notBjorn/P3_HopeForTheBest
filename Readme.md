## **Collaboration & Sources**
This code and the logic used in it is mine. Throughout this project I was really confused as to what i was supposed to do so i had to ask my peers some clarifying questions regarding the goals of the project but besides that no other help was used from other students in this class. I did use the Clion inbuilt AI for the first time, but the purpose of that was just to help me find some random errors and warnings I was receiving which I will explain further in Implementation.
## **Implementation Details**
The code i implemented was heavily influenced from the labs we had done, especially the binary search tree lab. But I did have to change the public interface of the priority Queue as without doing so I could not find a way to write the freq file.
## **Testing & Status**
I think my code works but due to some errors I received when trying to run the code on the blue server I am not sure if my code is working perfectly. I did run the code locally and on blue without using the scripts and I did get output that looked good. So I am not sure if and what I did incorrectly. I have attached some screenshots of the errors I received and the output i got when running manually.
